Core Challenges

-- Object Ownership & Structure
Do players "own" their hands? What if other players bet on their hand? What if the dealer needs to access the bet(s)
associated with their hand? What if the player elects not to bet on their hand or they bet on other players hands?
Can players use one another's empty positions?

The solution to these problems was to make Table the master object and populate it with Position objects. There are two
disjoint Position objects - Player Position and Dealer Position. Player Positions are what the players can actually bet
on and these contain Hands. The reason why Players do not directly store an instance of their Hand is because Hands can
be split (leading to the presence of multiple hands) and because other players can technically allowed to "back-bet" on
their hand. For these reasons, it made sense to use the Table-Position model as opposed to the Player-Hand model.

---- Dealer Hand vs. Player Hand

A special type of data structure was required for logging the bets on each position. This is because Blackjack allows
players to buy insurance on multiple positions, meaning that if we were to log player bets on each hand in a HashMap,
the keys in the map will not be unique. Since the Map.Entry interface does not enforce key-value uniqueness I chose to
compose it in an ArrayList of entries which logs all the bets on a particular position. This data structure is similar
to a Multimap, but naturally it foregoes the constant lookup time of a HashMap.

---- Acting Player vs. Default Player
---- Standard Bets vs. Insurance Bets
---- Double Down Bets

    /* -- deprecated data structures --
     * These don't work because all implementations of the Map interface in Java enforce key uniqueness. Player's can
     * theoretically have multiple bets on a position by doubling down and buying insurance so these data structures
     * can't be used in the PlayerHand class.
     *
     * private TreeMap<Player, Bet> pairs;
     * private HashMap<Player, Bet> pairs; */
