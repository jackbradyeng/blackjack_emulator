Performance Notes

It's worth pointing out that simulation mode can be very computationally intensive, particularly for high iteration
counts. On my personal machine, a Monte Carlo simulation takes approximating 3 seconds to complete for a 100,000
iteration size and 15 seconds for a 500,000 iteration size. Of course your mileage may vary, but for reference see my
personal system settings below:
